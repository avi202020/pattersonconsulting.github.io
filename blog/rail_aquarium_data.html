						<h1>Rail, Aquariums, and Data</h1>
						<p>Author: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jpatanooga">Josh Patterson</a></p>
						<p>Date: May 25th, 2018</p>
						<p>As we approach the June 11th date for the <a href="http://www.dlchattconference.com/">2018 Chattanooga Deep Learning Conference</a>, we wanted to write an article explaining the approach for our investment in this conference.</p>
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xkwl0k_p3FI" style="float: right; margin: 12px;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

						<p>At Patterson Consulting we believe <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/101020/full/467906a.html">graduate-level research output to be a key driver in the economies of cities</a> around the globe. As an alumnus of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and a life-long Chattanooga-area resident, I can see a need for bolstering suppoort of the local computer science graduate program as a long-term investment in regional economic development.
							<br/>
							<b>This investment thesis for a region comes down to: <i>"you don't have to found Google in your city to get key companies to locate there, but you DO have to invest in your local graduate programs in a significant way."</i></b>

						</p>
						<p>To support this central thesis in this article we put forth the following argument:
							<OL>
								
								<LI>Software is eating the world, and effects like the <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/managing-our-hub-economy">hub economy</a><sup>[ref.1]</sup> are an increasing threat to cities like Chattanooga.</LI>
								<LI><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/software-eats-manufacturing-and-manufacturing-gains/">Software sector continues to grow</a>, while manufacturing (long the core industry in cities like Chattanooga) <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602869/manufacturing-jobs-arent-coming-back/">continues to decline</a></LI>
								<LI>Historically Chattanooga was able to stay relevant in key industries such as manufacturing by staying relevant through <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/200809_Chattanooga.pdf">river, rail, and interstate investments</a></LI>
								<LI>To evolve the economy again, to stay relevant, Chattanooga must find more ways to connect to high-growth industries such as the software industry</LI>
								<LI>High growth economy cities <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/101020/full/467906a.html">tend to correlate</a> with vibrant tech sectors coupled with top-tier research output</LI/>
									<!--
								<LI>To drive economic growth Chattanooga needs to make the long-term investment of growing its research output in the hard sciences, specifically computer science, over the next decade.</LI>
							-->
							</OL>


						</p>

						<p>

						Software is integrating, displacing, and fundamentally changing nearly every industry in the global economy, as illustrated in the quote by Marc Andreessen:
						<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">
						  <p style="font-size: 14px;">
						  <i>“More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online services — from movies to agriculture to national defense. Many of the winners are Silicon Valley-style entrepreneurial technology companies that are invading and overturning established industry structures. Over the next 10 years, I expect many more industries to be disrupted by software, with new world-beating Silicon Valley companies doing the disruption in more cases than not.”</i></p>
						  <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">"Why Software is Eating the World"</a>, <a href="https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">Marc Andreessen</a></p>
						</blockquote>

						This <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/managing-our-hub-economy">"hub-economy"</a> effect has accelerated to the point that some countries see not other countries as economic threats, but specific companies as threats:

						<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">
						  <p style="font-size: 14px;">
						  <i>“Data centric tech companies are participating in the new economy at a greater proportion than other companies
							The British East India Company was the first example of a successful global monopoly that massively extracted and redistributed wealth. The danger today is that we stand at the cusp of a new era of exploitation, this time not by other countries but companies; we should all be grateful to Facebook for alerting us to this threat. We must be careful before mindlessly celebrating disruptive innovation.”</i></p>
						  <p><a href="https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Musings/without-strong-data-law-india-will-end-up-as-a-digital-colony-of-us-chinese-firms/">"Without strong data law, India will end up as a digital colony of US, Chinese firms"</a>, Ravi Venkatesan, former chairman of Microsoft India</p>
						</blockquote>


						<p style="color: red;">



						</p>


						While software is in high growth mode, manufacturing job numbers <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602869/manufacturing-jobs-arent-coming-back/">fall while the manufacturing sector total output rises</a>. Software has had an <a href="http://fortune.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/">impact in driving this output growth</a>, obviously, which makes it a compelling candidate to focus on as manufacturing slows as a viable growth industry.

							Why should we focus on software as opposed to other industries? Specifically software applications such as:
							<ul>
								<li>advanced analytics</li>
								<li>machine learning</li>
								<li>deep learning</li>
								<li>storage and database technology</li>

							</ul>

							We point out these technologies and their related field specifically because data analysis, storage, and processing underpins large swathes of the 4th Industrial revolution:

						<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">
						  <p style="font-size: 14px;">
						  <i>“In his book, The Fourth Industrial Revolution, professor Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, describes how this fourth revolution is fundamentally different from the previous three, which were characterized mainly by advances in technology. These technologies have great potential to continue to connect billions of more people to the web, drastically improve the efficiency of business and organizations and help regenerate the natural environment through better asset management.[11]”</i></p>
						  <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Industrial-Revolution-Klaus-Schwab/dp/1524758868">"The Fourth Industrial Revolution"</a>, Klaus Schwab</p>
						</blockquote>

						While software is growing quickly as in industry, it has created a new layer of networked connections that are constantly generating data. This data needs compelling new techniques to create value, squeezing efficiency out of older systems to keep industries improving, keeping them competitve in a global economy.




						</p>
						<p>So in this article we'll connect the dots from investing in key graduate level research to regional ecnomic growth. We'll take a look at Chattanooga's beginnings as a river port and how it has evolved to meet economic changes over time. We'll also look at how other global cities are finding success in this new economy, and then close with what Patterson Consulting is doing locally to help support graduate research output in this region. Let's start off by making the case for why we should make direct investments in our local graduate programs.</p>

						<h2>Economic Impact of Research and Development</h2>
						<p>
						<img src="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/101020/images/Top-cities-pub.jpg" width="425" height="272" style="float: left; margin: 12px;" />
						We're seeing <A href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/managing-our-hub-economy">hub-economy tech companies</a> appear in certain large cities, but not others. These class of technology companies capture a disproportionate and expanding share of value of the <a href="https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">industries they disrupt</a>. What is the separating factor in terms of which cities tend to create key technology companies and which ones do not? An interesting correlation is looking at which cities have universities generating large amounts of research as we see in the graph to the right. The basis for our thesis on investing in graduate programs comes from the correlation of economic growth in cities which can be tied to top end universities and publication counts. The quote below from the article goes on to state:
						

						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-12" id="fh5co-content">

						<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">
						  <p style="font-size: 14px;">
						  <i>“Both analyses highlight cities in which scientific output is growing. In particular, Beijing, which churned out 0.76% of the global output in 1996, produced 2.74% in 2008 (319,000 research papers). Other fast-growing areas are Tehran, Istanbul, Seoul, Singapore City and São Paulo.”</i></p>
						  <p>C. W. Matthiessen, A. W. Schwarz and S. Find Urban Stud. 47, 1879–1897; 2010</p>
						</blockquote>

						In the United States both the San Franciso area ("Silicon Valley") and Boston are well-known hubs of technology companies. We can see in chart above they both rate in hte top 10 in the world in producing research publications.

						</p>
						<p>

<img src="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/101020/images/Top-cities-citation.jpg" width="475" height="373" style="float: right;" />

							The article goes on to further examine how citation count of publications can further color the discussion to see how quantity is not always better than quality. In this light we see how cities like Boston and Austin produce high quality research while not always producing the same numbers of publications, but keeping citation count high.

							
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12" id="fh5co-content">

						The article goes on to make the observation:


						<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">
						  <p style="font-size: 14px;">
						  <i>"Take three or four of the best universities in the world, put them in a city with a seaport, and voilà!" says Lobo. But copying the region's formula is quite another matter. How can one city start to emulate another that attracts the most research funding in the United States and has been built up over centuries?”</i></p>
						  <p>From the article:</br> 
							<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/101020/full/467906a.html">Cities: Building the best cities for science</a></p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>
						The quote teases the question about how another city can copy some of the same ideas from successful cities like Boston, or Austin, which tend to "punch above their weight". We'll take a look at the recommendations later on in this article. 
					</p>
						<p>
							Beyond citations, we also see large investment dollars by large technology companies in new research labs clustered in these same cities and emerging regions like Toronto<sup>[2]</sup>, Canada:

							<ul>
								<li><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/facebook-opening-new-ai-lab-in-seattle-as-it-hires-uw-professor/">Facebook opens new lab in Seattle, WA</a></li>
								<li><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/12/22/torontos-thriving-ai-ecosystem-serves-as-a-model-for-the-world/	">Toronto</a> gains significant <a href="https://torontolife.com/tech/ai-superstars-google-facebook-apple-studied-guy/">investment</a></li>
								<li>Facebook opens Paris, France <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/06/introducing-facebook-ai-research-paris/">AI Lab</a></li>
								

							</ul>

							These lab investment tend to cluster in cities that house high-end research institutes that produce specific types of STEM research. In the examples above, we see the investment largely cluster around graduate programs producing deep learning research, as the field of deep learning is largely credited for advances in computer vision, robotics, and advanced sensor analysis (among others).

						</p>
						<h2>Correlating High-Output Research Regions with Key Technology Company Formation</h2>
						<p>Now let's correlate these high-producing research cities with key large technology companies, and trace those back to the ones that were founded from students at the schools.

							<UL>
								<LI>San Francisco Area (Sillicon Valley)</LI>
								<LI>Boston, MA</LI>
								<LI>Seattle, WA</LI>
								<LI>Austin, TX</LI>

							</UL>
							Where in San Francisco we have more core companies than we can exhaustively list:
							<UL>
								<LI>Google<sup>[footnote:google]</sup></LI>
								<LI>Facebook</LI>
								<LI>Twitter</LI>
								<LI>Uber</LI>
								<LI>Oracle</LI>
								<LI>Cisco</LI>
								<LI>VMWare</LI>

							</UL>
							Along with their class of 2017 IPOs:
							<UL>
								<LI>Cloudera</LI>
								<LI>Okta</LI>
								<LI>Mongo</LI>
								<LI>Mule</LI>
							</UL>
							
</p><p>
							The key schools in the area are Stanford and University of CA at Berkeley. Notable companies that trace their origins back to those schools include:

							<UL>
								<LI>Google - Stanford</LI>
								<LI>Cisco - Stanford</LI>
								<LI>Trifacta - Berkeley, Stanford</LI>
								<LI>LinkedIn - Stanford</LI>
								<LI>Confluent - Jay Kreps (and more) developed Kafka at LinkedIn, spun out to create new company</LI>
								<li>Cloudera - Dr Amr Amadallah, Stanford</LI>
							</UL>

							Then we have prolific researchers who's careers spanned multiple schools (Berkeley, MIT) and created multiple companies at both school, most notably Dr. Michael Stonebraker:

							<UL>
							<LI>Daniel Abadi, co-founder of Hadapt (acquired by Teradata)</LI>
							<LI>Robert Epstein (founder and former VP of engineering of Sybase)</LI>
							<LI>Diane Greene (co-founder and former CEO of VMWare)</LI>
							<LI>Paula Hawthorn (founder of Britton-Lee, formerly VP of engineering of Informix)</LI>
							<LI>Gerald Held (former VP of engineering of Oracle)</LI>
							<LI>Joseph M. Hellerstein (faculty at UC Berkeley, co-founder of Trifacta)</LI>
							<LI>Mike Olson (former CEO of Sleepycat Software and founding CEO of Cloudera)</LI>
							<LI>Margo Seltzer (Professor of Computer Science at Harvard, founder and former CTO of Sleepycat Software)</LI>
							<LI>Dale Skeen, founder of Tibco, founder and CEO of Vitria</LI>
							<LI>Anupam Bhide, founder and CEO of Calsoft</LI>
							</UL>

							Combined, Cal Berkeley and Stanford have likely incubated more tech success stories than any other region in the world in terms of pure market cap valuation. When you have 50 years of compounding effects of private and public joint investment in a region (and favorable market trends), we see a region create economic output that is likely unique in the world today (translation: its hard to replicate this easily). 

						</p>
						<p>

							We can go on to examine some of the success stories in the Boston region (with more than 30 schools in the region):

							<UL>
							<LI>Akamai Technologies (students out of MIT)</LI>
							<LI>EMC</LI>
							<LI>Skyworks</LI>
							<LI>Wayfair</LI>
							<LI>TripAdvisor (Harvard)</LI>
							<LI>MathWorks</LI>
							<LI>HubSpot</LI>
							<LI>Boston Dynanics</LI>
							<LI>iRobot</LI>
							<LI>Raytheor</LI>
							</UL>

							Powerhouse research programs such as Harvard, MIT, and more call the Boston area home. We not only see many companies formed in the area around this cluster of research output, but we also see a lot of companies like Amazon and Microsoft putting labs in this regions as well.
						</p>
						<p>


							With Seattle, WA, obviously the two most famous technology companies would be Microsoft and Amazon. Jeff Bezos is on <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2011/meet-shel-kaphan-amazoncom-employee-1/2/">record as saying</a> engineering talent availability was a major factor in starting Amazon in Seattle<sup>[?]</sup> with the University of Washington as a fertile computer science recruiting ground.


							Austin, TX is another interesting case where we don't see as many of the companies formed there, but we see nearly every major tech company with a large office in Austin.

							Companies <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/11/austin-is-top-place-for-startups-in-america-not-silicon-valley.html">founded in Austin, TX</a> Area:
							<UL>
								<LI>Dell</LI>
								<LI>Indeed.com</LI>
								<LI>HomeAway</LI>
								<LI>Netspend</LI>
								<LI>Q2ebanking</LI>
							</UL>


							Major companies with large offices in Austin, TX:
							<UL>
								<LI>Facebook</LI>
								<LI>Amazon</LI>
								<LI>Microsoft</LI>
								<LI>General Motors</LI>
								<LI>Cloudera</LI>
								<LI>Apple</LI>
								<LI>Oracle</LI>
								<LI>IBM</LI>
							</UL>




							



						</p>
						<p>

							While not every single company was founded by 2 people out of a garage in Palo Alto, a lot of these companies have at least part of their origin story connected to research produced by high-performing graduate programs. These people ended up in the area specifically for those graduate programs, and ended up staying close to found key technology companies.

						</p>
						<p>

							A counter-argument to the relationship between these cities and high output graduate programs might be the argument that these cities have well-funded computer science programs due to the abundance of wealthy tech companies pouring in money; its more likely that these programs feed the region with candidates, pulling in companies, who pour money back into programs in a virtuous cycle. <b>What we do not see are regions that have robust tech sectors without high-producing regional phd programs in computer science.</b> 

						</p>
						<p>


							The compounding and derivative effects of regional graduate research, research labs, and the formation of key technology companies created tend to show yeild over time in certain key cities. We believe investment in specifically graduate research programs is how these ecosystems of technology are booted up for the long-run. Those things being said, these are long-term-class investments, which are not easy to make. Let's take a look at what factors have contributed to success in fostering research output in regions (and then what did not work).

						<h2>Factors for Fostering Regional Scientific Research Output</h2>
						If we've established at least a correlating link between research output in a region and economic success, the next logical though is "what are some solid steps to making this happen?". The Nature.com article goes on to give advice for would-be technology hub cities:

						<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">
						  <p style="font-size: 14px;">
						  <i>“From case studies, Mary Walshok, a sociologist at the University of California, San Diego, picks out three important factors that make cities sticky for scientists. Promise them the freedom to work on their own ideas. Then give them the tools and infrastructure to do so. Public funding is key to achieving these first two aims, but local private corporations and philanthropists who endow new buildings or research chairs also help. "You can see this happening in Austin, and in Seattle," says Walshok.”</i></p>
						  <p>From the article:</br> 
							<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/101020/full/467906a.html">Cities: Building the best cities for science</a></p>
						</blockquote>

						The article continues on, highlighting "lifestyle":

						<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">
						  <p style="font-size: 14px;">
						  <i>“Walshok's third factor is an attractive lifestyle. Richard Florida, a sociologist and economist at the University of Toronto's Martin Prosperity Institute in Canada, lists scientists among the 'creative class': mobile, talented, creative thinkers that a city must lure in with amenities and smart urban planning.”</i></p>
						  <p>From the article:</br> 
							<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/101020/full/467906a.html">Cities: Building the best cities for science</a></p>

						So to extract and highlight the factors:
						<OL>
							<LI>Freedom to work on their own ideas</LI>
							<LI>Tools and infrastructure to do so</LI>
							<LI>Attractive lifestyle</LI>

						</OL>
						The article also highlights the need for public + private partnerships to drive the first two, which we'll touch more on in a minute. Outside.com has already rated Chattanooga as the "Best Town Ever", so I think we have "attactive lifestyle" covered.


						</p>
						<p>At this point its easy to say "well this doesn't sound too hard", but the study does outline some specific examples where investment did not pan out as well as the city had hoped. The go on to point out how some research is not easy to commercialize, and that you cannot always setup a few labs and expect to attract outside talent to pick up and invest in roots in your area:

						<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">
						  <p style="font-size: 14px;">
						  <i>Even with the right ingredients — freedom, funding and lifestyle — to attract and keep scientists, there is no guarantee that their work will generate economic wealth. Lobo points out that New Mexico probably has the highest number of physicists per capita in the United States, thanks to the Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories, but it is hardly an economic powerhouse, as the research doesn't lend itself to commercialization. Boston, on the other hand, has a strong foundation of basic science that has attracted companies and institutes, which in turn has created wealth and attracted more top scientists.</i></p>
						  <p>From the article:</br>

<p>

						<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">

						  <i>Boston's economic resilience, born of a diverse labour force, is key to this virtuous cycle. Science is merely the latest in a series of economic rebirths — from being the largest city in early colonial America, to a centre for global shipping and sailing in the nineteenth century, to its current position as a biotech hub. Similar tales of success are told for the San Francisco area, with its attractive climate, culture of adventurous investment and laws that favour creative workers.</i></p>

						Getting established industry researchers and practictioners to move to your town and start an industry from scratch is a tall hill to climb most times. Sillicon Valley took nealy 50 years to become what it is today, and Boston is one of the oldest cities in the United States. In terms of exemplar cities to emulate, they are poor direct examples for cities like Chattanooga. What we do find as a compelling exemplar city is Austin, TX.

 
					</p>
					<p>
						<h2>Austin as a Model for Mid-Sized City Research Investment</h2>

						We want to point out Austin, TX as a great example of what "could-be" for a mid-sized city with a solid academic institution nearby, along with an attractive lifestyle. Another interesting correlation is that Texas in general is culturally similar to Tennessee, at least moreso than Boston or Silicon Valley. Both Chattanooga and Austin are river towns and have vibrant downtowns with a nearby university system. The major difference to point out is how highly the University of Texas (Austin) ranks on the publication list (quantity, and quality), versus how the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga does not show up on these lists<sup>[footnote]</sup>.
						


					</p>
					<p>
						If Chattanooga could produce 1/3 of the successful startups listed above for Austin, and could get any one of the major companies to build a lab in the area, what would that be worth to the local economy?

					</p>
					<p>Remember, the sepecific factor these companies came to Austin for was the abundance of quality workforce suitable for high-tech jobs. These workforce was there because of the University of Texas, and more notably was trained by the graduate programs by high producing world-class researchers. 

					<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">
					  <p style="font-size: 14px;">
					  <i>“There is a very strong track record of places that attract talent becoming places of long-term success,” said Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard and author of “Triumph of the City.” “The most successful economic development policy is to attract and retain smart people and then get out of their way.”</i></p>

					</blockquote>

					Austin gets talented folks to move there for school, and then they keep these candidates in the local region with lifestyle and top-tier jobs. Austin may not have the same number of billion-dollar exits as Silicon Valley, but it doesn't need to that in order to enjoy regional economic success based on the rise of the technology industry. <b>Simply put, Austin has made investments in their graduate program and, over time (not over night), enjoyed higher economic output for their region while creating more derivative jobs for non-technology workers in the process:</b>

					<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">
					  <p style="font-size: 14px;">
					  <i>"The economic effects reach beyond the work the young people do, according to Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of “The New Geography of Jobs.” For every college graduate who takes a job in an innovation industry, he found, five additional jobs are eventually created in that city, such as for waiters, carpenters, doctors, architects and teachers."</i></p>

					So if we want to take steps to emulate another city, let's remember where Chattanooga came from and how it has evolved multiple times over the years to stay relevant.

						<h2>Evolution of Regional Chattanooga Economy</h2>
						
						<p>In 1815 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Chattanooga">John Ross settled the spot on the river</a> as a river port, and the city’s growth was stimulated by the arrival of the railroads in the 1840s and ’50s. Quickly developing into a railroad hub for the south, rail played a key role in the economic development of Chattanooga, among other similar cities:

						<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">
						  <p style="font-size: 14px;">
						  <i>“The railroad had its largest impact on the American transportation system during the second half of the 19th century. The standard historical interpretation holds that the railroads were central to the development of a national market in the United States and served as a model of how to organize, finance and manage a large corporation”</i></p>
						  <p>Alfred D. Chandler Jr.:The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business(1977) pp 81–121.</p>

						Industry flourished in Chattanooga due in large part to rail growth<sup>[footnote]</sup> as there were 58 industries in the city in 1870, growing to more than 300 industries by 1910 [ ref ]. Post-WWII we see a progressive decline in rail usage as the interstate system plays an increasing role in moving people and goods throughout America. The Interstate Highway System was signed into legislation in the 1956 by Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
					</p><p>
						A key decision that kept Chattanooga relevant as a city was having the interstate run through the city to keep people and goods flowing through the city as rail continued to decline. Originally the interstate system did not run through Chattanooga but Mayor P.R. Olgiati had the foresight to recognize the economic impact to the region and lobbied to change the plans to include Chattanooga<sup>[footnote:Olgiati]</sup> making Chattanooga the first city in Chattanooga to have a completed interstate, keeping the city as a key connection point to other major cities such as Atlanta, Nashville, and Knoxville. 

					</p>
					<p>
					As a river port, a central rail hub, and then a connector in the interstate highway system, Chattanooga has always had part of its identity tied to being a key conduit in moving goods and people. Having the foresight to innovate and stay relevant in an evolving economy of moving people and goods has proven to be a fruitful strategy for the city for nearly 150 years. 

					Chattanooga has always seen success in the <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/the-supply-chain-economy-and-the-future-of-good-jobs-in-america">supply-chain economy</a>, and at one time saw success in the manufacturing economy as well. However, as many Rust-Belt cities found, the combination of global outsourcing and software integration into the manufacturing fields has seen Chattanooga's employment in manufactoring drop from 34% in 1940 down to 16% in 2000.
						<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">
						  <p style="font-size: 14px;">
						  <i>“Like many cities, Chattanooga was hit hard by deindustrialization. After reaching its peak
							in 1979, the country’s manufacturing employment declined by more than 7 percent during
							the decade (see Figure 3). The loss of manufacturing had an even greater effect on Chattanooga.
							Between 1980 and 1990, the number of Chattanoogans employed in manufacturing
							declined 28 percent, to 12,231, or about one in five workers. Fifty years earlier, more
							than one in three Chattanoogans worked in manufacturing.

						</blockquote>
						While the success in the supply-chain economy could be considered a stabilizing factor in the region economically, it wasn't enough to completely mitigate the effects of 50-years of consistent manufacturing decline; 
						Manufacturing decline sent the city into a tailspin, with the Brookings article going on to state:
						<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">
						  <p style="font-size: 14px;">
						  <i>“As the number of manufacturing jobs declined, so did the number of city residents. After
losing almost 10 percent of its population in the 1960s, Chattanooga lost another 10
percent during the 1980s, and for the first time in a century, Hamilton County’s population
declined as well. Downtown had—like many other U.S. downtowns—became a ghost
town. Few families believed their college-bound children would ever return—there were no
jobs and there seemed to be little future. At the beginning of the 1990s, Chattanooga was
a hard-hit Rust Belt city.
							”</i></p>

						</blockquote>
						It's difficult to read the stark contrast between the previous section's call for keeping our best and brightest at home for long term success, and how over the past 50 years through manufacturing attrition Chattanooga had gotten to the point where it was a city where families did not expect their children to return.

						<h2>Urban Rebirth, Public + Private Partnerships, and The Tennessee Aquarium</h2>

							In the 1990's Chattanooga was experiencing a decades long decline as the world around it changed. Only though making strategic investments through public + private partnerships was Chattanooga able to stabalize the decline and return to economic growth, making the downtown area (once a ghost town), a desirable place to live again.

						</p>
						<p>
							Public + private partnerships were able to drive change in Chattanooga's narrative by introducing a plan to <a href="">reinvent the city</a>, making it a national attraction. Most people credit the story of the Tennessee Aquarium of the city's reinvention (and to a degree, it is emblematic), but ultimately it was the combination of multiple forces as described in the quote below:
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-12" id="fh5co-content">
						


						<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey" style="padding: 16px; font-size: 12px;">
						  <p style="font-size: 14px;">
						  <i>"The task force, working with an outside consultant, recommended the creation of the Tennessee River Park along a 22-mile stretch of the Tennessee River. The goal was to create a world class corridor of linear parks—both as a means of providing amenities to local residents and to begin the process of making Chattanooga a regional attraction. The plan for the Riverpark, completed in March 1985, concluded that “[I]f properly done, reconnecting the city with its river, not only physically but by active use, will strengthen community pride. Tourists will be attracted and the word will spread, an essential step in focusing business and investment interest on Chattanooga.”</i></p>

						<p>

							Soon after we see Chattanooga make news with EPB's introduction of <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezpk77/chattanooga-gigabit-fiber-network">gigabit internet</a> across the region, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/technology/fast-internet-service-speeds-business-development-in-chattanooga.html">changing perception</a> of the city across the country. Chattanooga again made a public + private capital investment and changed its own narrative further, again using the same recipe.

						</p>
						<p>
							Turning around the downtown area was a building block for mitigating the population loss and it required planning, coordination, and invested capital between many groups such as the Chattanooga Venture, the RiverCity Company, the Lyndhurst Foundation, individual donors (e.g., Jack Lupton, others). Today we see further waves of this planning with the Riverpark connecting all the way to St. Elmo and Lookout Mountain, along with plans for a redeveloped south side. <a href="https://epb.com/">EPB's</a> success with the fiber investment can also be considered another regional building block that gave Chattanooga a more modern narrative on the national scene. 

						</p>

						<p>Obviously we'd be remiss if we did not note the technical successes of Chattanooga such as the <a href="https://www.cityscopemag.com/city-scope/how-we-did-it/">acquisition of Access America Transport by Coyote Logistcs</a>, which created further regional investment through the <a href="https://www.lamppostgroup.com/">Lamp Post Group</a>. We've also seen the rise of incubators such as the CO.LAB and competitions like <a href="http://colab.co/accelerator/gigtank/">GigTank</a> increase in Chattanooga due to the confluence of investment.

						<h1>Making the Case for Regional Graduate Research Investment</h1>
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AKbM6GvBM48" style="float: right;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p>We'll start out by re-stating our opening thesis:


							</p>
							<p>
							<b style="color: red;"><i>"you don't have to found Google in your city to get key companies to locate there, but you DO have to invest in your local graduate programs in a significant way."</i></b>
						</p>
						<p>
							We showed how <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/101020/full/467906a.html">research output in a region correlates to economic output</a>, along with the effect of <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/subscriber-only/2018/02/23/the-list-largest-austin-area-tech.html">attracting top-tier labs (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc)</a>. These areas, when the effects have enough years to compound over time, tend to create <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/managing-our-hub-economy">hub-economy</a>-class companues (Google, Facebook, Uber, etc) that participate in value creation and disruption at a rate much higher than normal. We've also seen how top-tier tech companies tend to either have a <A href="https://scet.berkeley.edu/mike-olson-revolutionizing-big-data-cloudera/">connection (founder graduated there)</a> to certain clustered universities in these areas or they were founded directly as a result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">research produced</a> there. We then listed the key factors from the <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/101020/full/467906a.html">Nature article</a>:
							<UL>
							<LI>Freedom to work on their own ideas
							<LI>Tools and infrastructure to do so<sup>[footnote: pub-private]</sup>
							<LI>Attractive lifestyle<sup>[footnote: lifestyle]</sup>
							</UL>
							While we noted the success of cities like Silicon Valley and Boston, MA in the context of this model, we go on to point out how Austin, TX is a better exemplar for the City of Chattanooga to emulate in its success. We've noted that while Austin tends to not found some of the key "hub" companies, Austin attracts their secondary labs which <a href="https://www.builtinaustin.com/2017/12/04/austin-2017-top-100-biggest-climbers">employ thousands</a> of people:
							<UL>
								<LI>Amazon - 900 Austin employees, office opened in 2015</LI>
								<LI>Facebook - 700 Austin employees, opened in 2010</LI>
								<LI>Apple</LI>
								<LI>Oracle</LI>
								<LI>Blizzard</LI>
								<LI>eBay</LI>
							</UL>
						</p>
						<p>

							Still we see a gap between Chattanooga has accomplished and what similar, yet economically more successful, cities such as Austin, TX, have accomplished in terms of attracting high-growth employers in the software space. If we had to point out the one major difference it would be the lack of compsci research output (typically correlated with lack of funding + support) for UTC's computer science program.

						</p>

						<p>
							The easiest counter points to our argument here would be:
							<OL>
								<LI>We already have the Sim Center and ORNL (Knoxville area) here; Why hasn't that produced more commercial output from their research?</LI>
								<LI>We already have incubators and startup competitions locally; Why isn't that enough?</LI>

							</OL>
							For #1, part of the answer is hard to define here, but I'll point back to the <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/101020/full/467906a.html">Nature article</a> that mentions how regions such as New Mexico have a lot of research locally (Los Alamos and <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/">Sandia national labs</a>) but do not always translate it into commercial success. Simply put, some types of scientific research do not translate well to the industrial or consumer space easily, so even with ancilliary support structures such as incubators or funding around them, they just don't produce more output beyond the papers they produce.
						</p>
						<p>
							For #2, while venture firms, incubators, and competitions are all helpful, they tend to not produce the same class of original technical IP as years of pure computer science research does. It's hard to replicate years of relational database research in a 6 week startup competition (for example), and it correlates that you see the industry-defining database companies coming from areas (Berkeley, Boston) that have made significant investment in their graduate research producing papers in that sector. 
						</p>
						<p>Another factor at play is that hard questions such as the ones we face in data science about <i>"what can I do with this sensor data?"</i> typically have the initial answer of <b style="color: red;">"we don't know"</b><sup>[footenote:we-dont-know]</sup>.

						</p>

						<h2>Getting Comfortable with "We Dont Know"</h2>

						<p>Why do graduate programs make the best places to develop answers for hard problems? Because its where the "We dont know" questions end up getting solved; Start-ups are better at commercializing compelling ideas when they have a basic initial answer, but they are beholden to finding "product market fit" (and from Seed to Series A funding) as soon as possible, not exploring the problem space.
						</p>
						<p>
							Corporations and private entities tend to have lots of data, but rarely the appetite for discovering compelling use cases with it because many times the answer to "what good is the data?" is "I dont know." --- these answers tend to make managers find reasons to change the subject quickly and find other things to do with their engineering time, so many times companies simply report that they still aren't sure how to proceed with data science initiatives

						</p>						

						<p>This article was meant to support the nacent UTC deep learning graduate program work (which is <a href="http://www.dlchattconference.com/">showcased at the 2018 Chattanooga DL Conference</a> if you have not yet signed up). This research group is focused on machine learning and data applications in:
							<UL>
								<LI>Healthcare</LI>
								<LI>Connected car / city</LI>
								<LIL>Powergrid / Smartgrid </LI>
							</UL>
							Which have underpinnings in computer science areas such as:

							<ul>
								<li>advanced analytics</li>
								<li>machine learning</li>
								<li>deep learning</li>
								<li>storage and database technology</li>

							</ul>


						</p>

						<p>
							The projects we'll see at this conference will display next-generation answers to hard problems in their respective spaces. The interesting aspect is that many of the approaches used in these projects are applicable to other fields, such as manufacturing. It's widely established that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602869/manufacturing-jobs-arent-coming-back/">manufacturing jobs are not coming back</a> in today's evolving global economy. However, no matter where the manufacturing jobs go, they are directly affected by the rise of software. Moving goods is still a good business to be in, so incubator focus on seems to be a good idea as <A href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/the-supply-chain-economy-and-the-future-of-good-jobs-in-america">supply chain success</a> will continue to benefit the region.

							Investing in software (as an economic driver) as software eats manufacturing seems to be a poetic response after Chattanooga's manufacturing decline, creating secondary jobs in the process for the region as a by-product of the investment.


						</p>


						<p>It may not be simple to get foundational tech companies that act as economic hubs to move to Chattanooga, but becoming a place that attracts their secondary offices ("spokes of the hub") connects to Chattanooga's history as a connector in the region (river, rail, interstate). If we put the graduate school investment in the light of the rail investment or the sacrifices made to get the interstate through Chattanooga, it fits in line with those historical narratives. Hopefully this time it won't cost us any more elevation off of Cameron Hill, though.

						</p>


						<p>
							In the context of Chattanooga's <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/200809_Chattanooga.pdf">lineage of public+private success</a> there are two near-term things that we suggest happen to drive graduate school investment for economic growth:

							<OL>
								<LI>get regional private organizations to donate data and collaborate on research with students to create compelling publishable results to drive graduate school research output</LI>
								<LI>raise funds to support more graduate students and pay more new researchers for the comp science program</LI>

							</OL>

						</p>




						<h2>What is Patterson Consulting Doing to Help?</h2>

						<p>
							<iframe src="http://www.oreilly.com/authors/widgets/782.html" height="500px" width="200px" style="float: right; margin: 6px;" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe>
							Obviously Patterson Consulting cannot move the needle across all the facets discussed above by itself. However, there are a few ways we can help support specifically the graduate program at UTC. If we look back at the start of this article, we suggest a focus on software applications such as:
							<ul>
								<li>advanced analytics</li>
								<li>machine learning</li>
								<li>deep learning</li>
								<li>storage and database technology</li>

							</ul>

							To that end we've set the following goals for the 2018 and 2019 academic years:

							<ol>
								<li>Be on the committee for the (hopefully annual) <a href="http://www.dlchattconference.com/">Chattanooga Deep Learning Conference</a></li>
								<li>Help mentor deep learning and distributed systems graduate students on research projects for alignment with industry</li>
								<li>Purposely hire and recruit from the UTC graduate program</li>
								<li>Provide guest lectures on deep learning</li>
								<li>Help build and deliver a graduate class on advanced distributed systems (Hadoop, Kafka, Information Retrieval)</li>

							</ol>
						</p>
						<p>
							To close, if we step back and take a look at where Chattanooga has been (rail), how it changed its narrative (the Tennessee Aquarium, parternships, planning), and then look at where the hub economy is going (data), we can summarize and title our whole thesis with the moniker:
						</p>
