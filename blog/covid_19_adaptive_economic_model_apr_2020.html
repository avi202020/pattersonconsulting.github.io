						<h1>An Adaptive Economic Model for Pandemics</h1>
						<p>Author: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jpatanooga">Josh Patterson</a>

							</p>
						<p>Date: April 16th, 2020</p>


						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>
							In this article we present the following thesis:


							<ol>

								<li>Currently due to uncertainty and existential fear, consumer confidence has plummeted and safe operational workplace protocol is uncertain</li>
								<li>To avoid accelerating economic decline, we need to optimize our regional operations such that we maximize our GDP output 
	while keeping the load on our healthcare systems to a manageable level</li>
								<li>economic activity is now tied to infection activity; fundamental to our economy</li>
								<li>We will likely be dealing with covid-19 infections that sporadically re-occur for an indefinite period of time</li>

							</ol>

							Given the above factors, we propose an Adaptable Economic Model for Pandemics (AEMP) 
							based on self-healing properties found in published mesh network optimization research<sup>[TinyTermite]</sup>.



							</ol>
						</p>


						<p>

							In our last report we <A href="http://www.pattersonconsultingtn.com/blog/covid_19_analyzing_tennessee_shutdown_apr_2020.html">analyzed the shelter-in-place effects for Tennessee and Hamilton County</A>s. In this report we build further on the concepts surfaced in the "shelter-in-place" analysis. 
							
						</p>
						

						<h3>Disclaimers</h3>
						<p>
							This report was created by Patterson Consulting as an informational analytical exercise. No healthcare bodies nor goverments are endorsing this report.

						</p>

						<h1>Covid-19 and the Economic Dilemma</h1>

						<p>
							Some have asserted that the government has needless held us back from working and hurting a non-trivial number of small and large businesses. Until we have some distance between the present and our current point, we won't have the data to deterine how needless the shelter-in-place / shutdowns actually were. However, what we do already know from observations in economic data is that shopping and spending patterns began to change in the 10-20 days leading up to when most businesses were ordered to shutdown. In the graph below (Via OpenTable), we can see how restaurant reservations began to decline in 37 states on average 73% over around 18 days before the state actually ordered shelter-in-place.

						</p>




						<div style="float: right; margin: 12px; border: 1px solid #999999; width: 1000px;">
						<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVqRhUlWAAgCQ_b?format=jpg&name=large" style="width: 753px; height: 453px; margin: 12px; border: 0px solid #999999;" />

						<p style="margin-left: 12px;"><i>Reduction of consumer confidence as shown by OpenTable's data.</i></p>
						</div>

						<p>
							For 5 consecutive weeks starting in early April, the United States has <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/04/23/us-unemployment-rate-numbers-claims-this-week-total-job-losses-april-23-2020-benefits-claims/">reported over 3 million unemployment claims per week</a>. This puts the real unemployment rate in the range of 20% with a total reported job loss of 26.5 million.



						</p>
						<p>
							In the same timespan, 50,000 people have died in the United States from the Covid-19. Here I make the correlation that as the death rate climbed in April, consumer confidence fell and people stopped buying goods and services in tradition brick and mortar ways. Consumers did not find an activity such as "going out to eat" worth the risk of potentially catching the virus and possibly infecting their family.

							</p>
							<p>

								At the same time, States and Counties saw the potential for a compounding daily growth rate of infections to overwhelm their local hospital systems. The prospect of such an outcome prompted most states in the United States to issue "shelter-in-place" directives to slow down the infection rate.

							</p>
							<p>
								However, by the time the shelter-in-place directives had been ordered in each state, consumer confidence had already fallen to significantly low levels. Consumers had already "shut down" some types of business with as a function of their existential fear, as we can see in the OpenTable graph above.



							</p>
							<p>

								In the diagram below, we show 3 maps on a per-county basis for the state of Tennessee:

								<ol>
									<li>Population by County</li>
									<li>GDP by County</li>
									<li>New Positive Covid-19 Infections by County</li>

								</ol>

							</p>




						<div style="float:right; margin: 12px; border: 1px solid #999999;">

						<p style="margin-left: 12px;"><i>Tennessee GDP, Population, and Infection Growth (4/1-4/16) Mapped.</i></p>
						</div>	

						<p>

								 In our <A href="http://www.pattersonconsultingtn.com/blog/covid_19_analyzing_tennessee_shutdown_apr_2020.html">previous article</A>, we analyzed how the counties in Tennessee that had the most infections in April also tended to have the most population and most GDP. These states had higher population densities that helped create conditions to more easily transmit the virus in their local populations. We could also see that counties with denser populations had larger drops on average in compounding daily growth rates (CDGR) during the shelter-in-place periods.

								

							</p>
							<p>
								With the above observations called out, I assert that under present pandemic conditions we see certain types of economic activity correlate with infection rates in counties. 
							</p>

							<p><span style="color: red;">In our present situation, rising infection rates tend to generate fear, and fear tends to reduce consumer confidence. Lower consumer confidence drives a downward trend in business revenue, leading to more unemployment.</span></p>
							<p>

							 Staying in this cycle has the potential to accelerate further economic decline, and in this way Covid-19 has created a non-trivial economic dilemma.
							</p>
						


						<br/>

						<h1>The Next 18 Months will be Uncertain</h1>

						<p>
							We need ways to rebuild consumer confidence but there will likely prove to be challenging. Consumers need to feel like they can safely enter a restaurant or get a haircut, and not endanger their families. Ideally a vaccine would be the best way to achieve this goal, but per Morgan Stanley analysts (graph below), it could be at least 18 months before a vaccine is widely available.

						</div>				
			

						<p>
							Without a near-term solution to assure consumers, we are now in uncertain territory. Businesses are used to being prepared for an "economic downtown", but few businesses have a "pandemic playbook".

						<h1>Adaptive Economic Model for Pandemics (AEMP)</h1>
						<p>
							
We don’t know how long the current conditions will last
Forecasting regional Covid-19 impact has been a moving target
We will likely get county-level spikes of infections periodically over the next 18 months
Operate the state of Tennessee on a per-county basis during pandemics
Only shutdown a county if the county has an infection daily CDGR that will exceed the number of usable Covid-19 beds in the next 14 days
Counties that continue to have low infection rates will continue to operate
Counties will have to adapt their workplace operational hygiene practices (masks, washing, etc)
We choose to optimize for:
Maximize the GDP output per county that is possible under Pandemic conditions
Minimize the operational impact to critical healthcare providers

						</p>
						<p>

							An adaptive hospitalization rate --- as more data comes online


						</p>
						<p>

							what if we never see a mass of infections?

						</p>
						<p>

							what if we see lots of infections ?

						</p>
						<p>

							We can't hide, but we can't push forward blindly either

						</p>


						<h2>Tennessee GDP vs Population vs Infection Growth</h2>
						<p>

							
							<ul>
								<li>The top 6 counties in Tennessee account for 62.8% of the GDP output</li>
								<li>Two of the top 6 (Memphis, Nashville) have the most Covid19 population count growth from 4/1 to 4/16</li>
								<li>Counties such as Hamilton County have stopped their infection rate growth</li>
								<li>Tennessee (and similar states) should move to a dynamic per-county optimized economic model to better optimize GDP output during a pandemic</li>
								<li>Goal: We want to maximize our per-county GDP while at the same time keeping our Covid-19 population at a level that can be sustained by our regional healthcare system</li>

							</ul>
							

						</p>



						<h2>Limiting Rate of the AEMP Model</h2>
						<p>
Each county should only operate at an infection CDGR level that will not outstrip its healthcare resources in any given time period
Ex: A mild flu season infects 7.4% of the population; at a hospitalization rate of 14% (if that holds), this would produce a significant number of hospitalizations across the 5 month season
Each hospital can only allocate so many beds to COVID-19 patients
And they typically operate at 50% capacity
If we allocate the remaining 50% to covid-19 patients, this would be the limiting factor per county (example: Hamilton county has around 400 beds that could be used for covid-19)
The forecast for each N weeks would compute
The number of new positive covid-19 patients x (hospitalization rate for covid-19)
The number of existing covid-19 patients that would be still hospitalized
If the sum of this number exceeds the covid-19 available bed count, then the county would be “down-shifted” into “cooldown mode” for a period of 14-21 days


						</p>

						<h2>Visualizing AEMP Forecast / Threshold</h2>

						<p style="margin-left: 12px;"><i>AEMP Forecast and Threshold, Visualized.</i></p>
						</div>	


						<h2>All Models are Wrong, Some are Useful</h2>
						<p>

							<ul>
								<li>forecasting covid-19 has been a moving target at best so far; many people stuck at home are frustrated to see a projected peak come and go without results matching the forecast. The danger, however, remains real</li>
								<li>given how little we know about the real infection population and how covid-19 moves, trying to forecast an infection peak for any area (with a model such as SIR) is likely difficult at best</li>
								<li>making economic operational rules at the state level does not make sense; a level of economic activity that makes sense for one county in a state will not for another as their infection timeline, populations, and growth rates may vary considerably</li>
								
								<li>we face a threat that we do not completely understand yet; we need to hope for the best but prepare for the worst. this is a tall order.</li>
								<li>We need to optimize our economy in ways that make sense; regions w little covid-19 activity should be put back to work generating GDP.</li>
								<li>regions with flashes of high covid-19 infection rates should be shutdown periodically to let the infection growth rate die down</li>

								<li>Regions of the world are getting infections rates under control only to see them come back</li>
								<li>we will likely have to deal with the virus until there is either a vaccine or therapeutics have driven the hospitalization load down</li>
								<li>we will likely be dealing with covid-19 for a long while</li>


							</ul>


						</p>


						<h2>Adaptive Economic Model Considerations</h2>
						<p>
							
							Each county has different factors impacting how effective they are at putting people to work along with how quickly Covid-19 can spread.
							<ul>
								<li>Some counties are sparsely populated so they tend not to have a high Covid-19 growth rate naturally --- every county will have different conditions</li>
								<li>Counties at lower risk should be able to operate at higher levels naturally because they don't drive Covid-19 infection rates as quickly as more urban areas</li>
								<li>Any county should seek to never operate at such a level that would create more healthcare burden than its regioanl healthcare system can sustain</li>
								<li>Any county can have sudden unexpected events that would create an emergency situation with Covid-19 growth acceleration; Any economic model should be flexible enough to isolate the county and reduce its growth rate while still seeking to maximize unaffected surrounded counties.</li>

								<li>the IHME model has been (unfairly) criticized for updating forecast; two critical factors were in play: (1) as more data came online they were able to make their model better (2) the entire world changed its behavior based on model forecasts, changing how the infection rate presented, therefore changing the underlying conditions the original model was based on</li>

								<li>[ article: restarts, and then shutdowns -- a difficult cycle ]</li>
								<li>[ article: a consumer with no confidence ]</li>
								<li>[ article: shutdown as a function of consumer confidence ]</li>


							</ul>

						</p>


						<h2>Design Improvements</h2>
						<p>

							updating the hospitalization rate as testing expands

							build a statistical model of different mitigation methods + results on county

							multiple levels




						</p>

						<h2>Summarizing the Challenge</h2>
						<p>
							<ul>

								<li>Currently due to uncertaintity and existential fear, consumer confidence has plummeted and safe operational workplace protocol is uncertain</li>

								<li>To avoid accelerating ecenomic decline, we need to optimize our regional operations such that we maximize our GDP output while keeping the load on our healthcare systems to a manageable level</li>

								<li>We will likely be dealing with covid-19 infections that sporadically re-occur for an indefinite length of time</li>

								<li>Given the above factors, in this article we present a Dynamic Adaptible Economic Model (DAEM) based on self-healing properties found in published mesh network optimization reasearch.</li>
								<li></li>
							</ul>


							

						</p>


						<h2>Summary Results</h2>

						<p>
							In this simulation we show how a dynamic ecenomic model can per-county optimize for both GDP maximization and covid-19 growth rate minimization at the same time.
						</p>
						<p>

							For a baseline 2-level system, the per-county adaptive economic model (CAEM) was X% more effective at GDP throughput as compared to a pure shutdown economy.


						</p>

						<p>

							For a baseline 2-level system, the adaptive economic model (CAEM) was X% more effective at GDP throughput as compared to a statewide uniform model that was shutdown every N days on average.


						</p>


						<p>
							Our effectiveness as local communities is what will eventually <a href="https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/how-scientists-quantify-intensity-of-an-outbreak-like-covid-19">drive the spread rate down (r0 < 1)</a>. To that end, being based in Hamilton County, we wanted to generate a regional forecast as part of helping to communicate the local challenges ahead in the month of April.

						</p>
						<p>
							Given this is something we normally would not blog about, we felt it compelling content as many in the community only see national numbers and its hard to extrapolate those into "how does this affect my local community". Each state, city, and county will see different growth rates and effects from this pandemic, so it makes sense to be able to see the macro-level data tailored to a specific region (e.g., "county"). This report is focused on building some foundational analytics for our region to help better tailor our community's response.

						<h2>An Unclear Timeline</h2>

						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Given the high infection rate, its unclear how long this virus will keep reappearing through 2020 - [singapore article]</li>
								<li>Given the current numbers, its a good bet that we'll continue to see low steady growth for the next 60 days</li>
								<li>There is also a chance we could see the infection rates level off. However, we hope for the best and plan for the worst</li>
								<li>Rt, although declining, is still in flux for every state</li>
								<li>Chattanooga didnt see a big burst, although the infections still keep slowly appearing</li>

							"Singapore, too, expects to go back and forth between different levels of restrictions, Lee said during the webinar, which might be the most sustainable strategy in the long run. Minimally intrusive policies, such as encouraging personal hygiene and telecommuting, are relatively easy to keep up, he noted, but it’s harder to limit the size of gatherings, cancel entertainment, and close schools and businesses for very long.

Experts in both cities believe setbacks are inevitable, as Singapore just learned. It reported 287 new cases on Thursday, its highest ever 1-day total. (Friday’s tally was 198; Saturday’s was 191.)"

"As long as this pathogen is circulating in the background and we don’t have a vaccine and very effective therapeutics, this is going to alter the way we live and do business. Some of it is going to be subtle. You’ll see businesses advertising deep cleanings. People aren’t going to shake hands as much anymore. Wearing masks in public is going to become more fashionable in Western societies.

Some of it’s going to be more profound. I don’t think the marginal customer for a stadium or a concert or a cruise ship is coming back soon. I think people are going to be more circumspect about travel, particularly international travel. Businesses are going to be more circumspect about bringing together large groups of people. So you’re going to see a change in the way we live, in the way we do business.

The question is: Can we get back to our normal level of economic activity with that kind of profound, pervasive change in the way we operate? It may be hard. That’s why I talk about the “80 percent economy.”
